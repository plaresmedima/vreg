Installation
------------

``vreg`` can be installed using pip:

.. code-block:: console

   pip install vreg

This installs the basic functionality building on `numpy` and `scipy`. If you 
want to use the built-in plotting functions from the `vreg.plot` module, 
you must install with:

.. code-block:: console

   pip install vreg[plot]

This will also bring in `matplotlib` and `pyvista` as dependencies.
